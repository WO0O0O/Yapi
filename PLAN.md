# YAPI - Gamified Nepali Language Learning Platform

## New Vision & Mission

YAPI will transform into an interactive, game-based platform for learning Nepali, complementing (rather than competing with) flashcard tools like Anki. The platform will focus on making language learning fun, engaging, and effective through various gamification elements.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (with TypeScript)
  - UI Library: Material UI or Chakra UI
  - State Management: Redux or Context API
  - Animation: Framer Motion
  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
  - Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
  - Authentication: JWT or OAuth
  - API: RESTful

## Core Gamification Concepts

1. **Experience Points (XP) System**
   - Users earn XP for completing games and activities
   - Level up system to track progress
   - Daily streaks and bonuses

2. **Achievement Badges**
   - Milestone badges for vocabulary mastery
   - Special badges for completing challenges
   - Cultural knowledge achievements

3. **Progress Visualization**
   - Nepali mountain climbing theme (tracking progress as climbing different peaks)
   - Village/map exploration unlocked as skills improve

## Game Types & Activities

### 1. Word Association Games

- **Word Connections**
  - Connect related Nepali words within time limits
  - Difficulty levels: beginner to advanced
  - Categories: food, family, travel, etc.
